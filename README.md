# OctoPrint-Dashboard

This is dashboard v2! It is still in the early stages of development so I really don't recommend you try it out yet.

If you really want to take a look, once you install it, add `/?dashboard` to the end of your octoprint url. 

Please see https://github.com/j7126/OctoPrint-Dashboard/issues/249 for more info/progress.
